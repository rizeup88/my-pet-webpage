    <h2>If you ever wanted a Golden Retriever, this will tell you all you need to know</h2>

    <h3 class="perks">Perks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Golden Retrievers are excellent at being dogs that relieve stress, and keep their owners active.</li>
        <li>They are especially recommended as a breed for seeing-eye dogs for those hard of sight.</li>
        <li>They take direction in a quick timeframe, and are friendly around children.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3 class="unique">What makes Estrella unique?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>She can recognize commands in both English and Spanish.</li>
        <li>She can sense your stress, and is quick to approach you to provide a sense of calm by petting her.</li>
        <li>Her diet is a fair combination of pellet-based food, and raw meat, which makes it easy to share a meal together.</li>
        <li>She prefers fetching rawhides, as opposed to balls or sticks.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3 class="thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
      <p>When considering pets that are faithful to their owners, and are dependable when you need them most, look no further than a dog. That's exactly why my Golden Estrella is both a best friend, and a lifelong companion my family and I have come to love."</p>
